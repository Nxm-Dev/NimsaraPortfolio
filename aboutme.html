            </h3>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>Hello! I’m Nimsara Jayathilaka, a dedicated Computer Science undergraduate currently pursuing my
                    third year at the <strong>Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT)</strong>. From a young age, I’ve
                    been fascinated by the intersection of science and technology. My academic journey began at
                    <strong>Kegalu Vidyalaya</strong>, where I developed a deep passion for exploring the world of
                    science, technology, and innovation. During my school years, I not only focused on academics but
                    also actively engaged in a variety of extracurricular activities, which helped shape my character
                    and leadership skills.

                    I served as <strong>Deputy Head Prefect</strong>, a role that not only developed my leadership
                    abilities but also instilled in me a sense of responsibility and an unwavering commitment to my
                    peers. Beyond leadership, I was an active member of the <strong>Senior Brass Band</strong> and
                    <strong>Drama Club</strong>, where I further honed my teamwork and communication skills. These
                    experiences taught me the importance of collaboration, discipline, and perseverance—qualities that I
                    bring into every professional project and endeavor I undertake today.
                </p>

                <p>In <strong>2021</strong>, I completed my A-levels with distinction in the science stream, which
                    opened the doors to my selection for the prestigious <strong>IIT Infoschol program</strong>. This
                    opportunity was a pivotal moment in my academic and professional journey, marking the beginning of
                    my specialized focus in technology and software development. Since then, I have immersed myself in
                    the world of <strong>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)</strong> systems, <strong>cloud
                        solutions</strong>, and <strong>business process automation</strong>, gaining hands-on
                    experience and developing a deep understanding of complex software architectures.

                    My academic and practical experiences have provided me with the tools and knowledge to become
                    proficient in <strong>ERP solutions</strong>, with a strong focus on <strong>Microsoft Dynamics 365
                        Business Central</strong>. Over the past few years, I’ve been actively involved in developing
                    and implementing <strong>Business Central</strong> solutions, which have empowered businesses to
                    streamline their operations and maximize their efficiency. I am passionate about creating innovative
                    solutions that solve complex business problems, and I am driven by the opportunity to turn ideas
                    into impactful, real-world applications.

                    I specialize in a range of <strong>Microsoft 365 technologies</strong>, including <strong>Power
                        Apps</strong>, <strong>Power Automate</strong>, and <strong>Azure DevOps</strong>, with a strong
                    emphasis on <strong>Agile methodologies</strong>. These tools allow me to design and deliver
                    end-to-end business solutions that are scalable, efficient, and adaptable to the ever-changing needs
                    of today’s digital landscape. My expertise in integrating platforms such as <strong>Shopify</strong>
                    with <strong>Business Central</strong> has also provided businesses with seamless, cross-functional
                    workflows that connect their eCommerce operations with ERP, enhancing their overall productivity.
                </p>

                <p>I pride myself on being a <strong>progressive thinker</strong> who thrives on working across all
                    stages of product development, from the initial <strong>ideation</strong> phase to
                    <strong>design</strong>, <strong>development</strong>, and eventual <strong>deployment</strong>. I
                    enjoy the challenge of taking a problem, thinking creatively, and developing solutions that not only
                    address the current needs but also anticipate future requirements. Whether I am building powerful
                    business intelligence tools, working on integration solutions, or optimizing business workflows, I
                    always approach each project with the same level of commitment and passion for excellence.
                    Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experiences, all of
                    which reflect my dedication to innovation and my passion for technology. Each project is a testament
                    to my commitment to delivering exceptional value and results. As I continue to grow in my career, I
                    am eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals and organizations to create solutions that
                    drive meaningful change and push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
