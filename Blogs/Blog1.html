                <h4>Artificial intelligence (AI) vs. machine learning (ML)</h4>
                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are two very hot buzzwords right now, and
                    often seem to be used interchangeably. They are not quite the same thing, but the perception that
                    they are can sometimes lead to some confusion. So I thought it would be worth writing a piece on the
                    difference between the two.</p>
                <p>Firstly, it is important to understand that the two terms are not interchangeable. Artificial
                    intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would
                    consider “smart”. Machine learning is a current application of AI based around the idea that we
                    should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves.</p>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is a broader concept: any technique that enables computers to mimic human
                    intelligence. Machine learning is a subset of AI, and it consists of the techniques that enable
                    computers to figure things out from the data and deliver AI applications.</p>
                <p>Machine learning is a data-driven approach that enables computers to find hidden insights without
                    being explicitly programmed where to look. The learning algorithm finds patterns in the data and
                    builds a model that can predict future outcomes. Machine learning is used in a range of computing
                    tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms is unfeasible.</p>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is a broader concept that involves machines being able to carry out tasks in
                    a way that we would consider “smart”. AI is a field of study that includes machine learning and
                    other techniques that enable computers to learn. The key difference is that AI is the broader
                    concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”.</p>

                What is <span>Artificial Intelligence?</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence is a broad field, which refers to the use of technologies to build machines and
                computers that have the ability to mimic cognitive functions associated with human intelligence, such as
                being able to see, understand, and respond to spoken or written language, analyze data, make
                recommendations, and more.</p>
            <p>
                Although artificial intelligence is often thought of as a system in itself, it is a set of technologies
                implemented in a system to enable it to reason, learn, and act to solve a complex problem.

            <h4 class="SubHeading">
                What is <span>Machine Learning?</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that automatically enables a machine or system
                to learn and improve from experience. Instead of explicit programming, machine learning uses algorithms
                to analyze large amounts of data, learn from the insights, and then make informed decisions.

                Machine learning algorithms improve performance over time as they are trained—exposed to more data.
                Machine learning models are the output, or what the program learns from running an algorithm on training
                data. The more data used, the better the model will get.

            <h4>
                How are AI and ML connected?
            </h4>
            <p>How are AI and ML connected? While AI and ML are not quite the same thing, they are closely connected.
                The simplest way to understand how AI and ML relate to each other is:</p>

            <p>AI is the broader concept of enabling a machine or system to sense, reason, act, or adapt like a human.
                ML is an application of AI that allows machines to extract knowledge from data and learn from it
                autonomously.</p>

            <p>One helpful way to remember the difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence is to
                imagine them as umbrella categories. Artificial intelligence is the overarching term that covers a wide
                variety of specific approaches and algorithms. Machine learning sits under that umbrella, but so do
                other major subfields, such as deep learning, robotics, expert systems, and natural language processing.
            </p>

            <p>Differences between AI and ML: Now that you understand how they are connected, what is the main
                difference between AI and ML? While artificial intelligence encompasses the idea of a machine that can
                mimic human intelligence, machine learning does not. Machine learning aims to teach a machine how to
                perform a specific task and provide accurate results by identifying patterns.</p>

            <p>Let’s say you ask your Google Nest device, “How long is my commute today?” In this case, you ask a
                machine a question and receive an answer about the estimated time it will take you to drive to your
                office. Here, the overall goal is for the device to perform a task successfully—a task that you would
                generally have to do yourself in a real-world environment (for example, research your commute time).</p>

            <p>In the context of this example, the goal of using ML in the overall system is not to enable it to perform
                a task. For instance, you might train algorithms to analyze live transit and traffic data to forecast
                the volume and density of traffic flow. However, the scope is limited to identifying patterns, how
                accurate the prediction was, and learning from the data to maximize performance for that specific task.
            </p>

            <p>Artificial intelligence allows a machine to simulate human intelligence to solve problems. The goal is to
                develop an intelligent system that can perform complex tasks. We build systems that can solve complex
                tasks like a human. AI has a wide scope of applications. AI uses technologies in a system so that it
                mimics human decision-making. AI works with all types of data: structured, semi-structured, and
                unstructured. AI systems use logic and decision trees to learn, reason, and self-correct.</p>

            <p>Machine learning allows a machine to learn autonomously from past data. The goal is to build machines
                that can learn from data to increase the accuracy of the output. We train machines with data to perform
                specific tasks and deliver accurate results. Machine learning has a limited scope of applications. ML
                uses self-learning algorithms to produce predictive models. ML can only use structured and
                semi-structured data. ML systems rely on statistical models to learn and can self-correct when provided
                with new data.</p>

            <p>Benefits of using AI and ML together: AI and ML bring powerful benefits to organizations of all shapes
                and sizes, with new possibilities constantly emerging. In particular, as the amount of data grows in
                size and complexity, automated and intelligent systems are becoming vital to helping companies automate
                tasks, unlock value, and generate actionable insights to achieve better outcomes.</p>

            <p>Here are some of the business benefits of using artificial intelligence and machine learning:</p>
