                <h4>Artificial intelligence (AI) vs. machine learning (ML)</h4>
                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are two very hot buzzwords right now, and
                    often seem to be used interchangeably. They are not quite the same thing, but the perception that
                    they are can sometimes lead to some confusion. So I thought it would be worth writing a piece on the
                    difference between the two.</p>
                <p>Firstly, it is important to understand that the two terms are not interchangeable. Artificial
                    intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would
                    consider “smart”. Machine learning is a current application of AI based around the idea that we
                    should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves.</p>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is a broader concept: any technique that enables computers to mimic human
                    intelligence. Machine learning is a subset of AI, and it consists of the techniques that enable
                    computers to figure things out from the data and deliver AI applications.</p>
                <p>Machine learning is a data-driven approach that enables computers to find hidden insights without
                    being explicitly programmed where to look. The learning algorithm finds patterns in the data and
                    builds a model that can predict future outcomes. Machine learning is used in a range of computing
                    tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms is unfeasible.</p>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is a broader concept that involves machines being able to carry out tasks in
                    a way that we would consider “smart”. AI is a field of study that includes machine learning and
                    other techniques that enable computers to learn. The key difference is that AI is the broader
                    concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”.</p>

                What is <span>Artificial Intelligence?</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence is a broad field, which refers to the use of technologies to build machines and
                computers that have the ability to mimic cognitive functions associated with human intelligence, such as
                being able to see, understand, and respond to spoken or written language, analyze data, make
                recommendations, and more.</p>
            <p>
                Although artificial intelligence is often thought of as a system in itself, it is a set of technologies
                implemented in a system to enable it to reason, learn, and act to solve a complex problem.

            <h4 class="SubHeading">
                What is <span>Machine Learning?</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that automatically enables a machine or system
                to learn and improve from experience. Instead of explicit programming, machine learning uses algorithms
                to analyze large amounts of data, learn from the insights, and then make informed decisions.

                Machine learning algorithms improve performance over time as they are trained—exposed to more data.
                Machine learning models are the output, or what the program learns from running an algorithm on training
                data. The more data used, the better the model will get.
